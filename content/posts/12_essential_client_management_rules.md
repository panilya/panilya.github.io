_Below are my notes from the insightful presentation "[Secrets to Optimal Client Service, With Jim Donovan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJbwyN4ZoCg&ab_channel=UniversityofVirginiaSchoolofLaw)" by the University of Virginia School of Law._

### Never use jargon

Clients likely won't understand technical terms, and they're even less likely to admit when they don't understand. This makes them feel foolish and they'll blame you for it.

### Use pauses

Pauses create opportunities for clients to ask questions or provide comments. Pauses also help you slow down, appear less anxious and more composed.

### Offer advice counter to your interests

Look for opportunities to provide advice that does not align with your personal interests. This demonstrates integrity and builds trust.

### Ask open-ended questions

Avoid yes/no questions. Open questions get clients talking about themselves (which people enjoy) and help you learn more about their needs.

### Be positive, upbeat

People are naturally drawn to positive individuals. Ex: When asked about your day, always respond positively.

### Separate Business from Social Activities

Maintain clear boundaries between personal life and business. Clients hire you for your expertise and work ethic, not your personal interests.

### Practice Humility

Make genuine complimentary comments. Example: "What you've accomplished with your company is extraordinary. It's impressive."

### Be Responsive to Clients

Especially important in early relationship stages. Respond promptly, even when you don't have a complete answer yet. This shows clients they matter to you.

### Take a position

Clients hire you for your expertise. Present options if needed, but advocate for one recommendation and stand firm.

### Control the meeting

When you're leading, it's your meeting. Don't allow others to hijack or sidetrack the discussion.

### Have a clear agenda

Walk into meetings with a prepared agenda. Communicate it at the start and ask "does that make sense?" to gain agreement. A structured plan keeps everyone focused and demonstrates professionalism.

### Document everything

Taking notes shows clients you won't forget important details. Summarize follow-up points at meeting's end. Like a waiter not writing down orders, not taking notes creates anxiety.
