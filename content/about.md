As an AI Engineer at BotsCrew, I've worked as a Lead AI Engineer on several AI-based products. I helped develop AI solutions for the MVP stage and was part of the projects for both startups and some Fortune 500 companies. My responsibilities included building AI components and ensuring they could be scaled appropriately as the products developed.

I've always been fascinated by Open-Source projects and its community and were participating in it way before my first commercial experience. One of the Open-Source project I‚Äôm proud to be involved in is [Datafaker](https://github.com/datafaker-net/datafaker).

I'm getting undergraduate degree in Software Engineering from Chernivtsi National University in Ukraine and I also believe that the best way to consolidate knowledge of something is to try to explain it to others which is the main reason why I write articles on interesting to me topics.
