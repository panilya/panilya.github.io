My name is Illia Pantsyr. I’m getting undergraduate degree in Software Engineering from Chernivtsi National University in Ukraine. I’ve worked with a wide variety of technologies over the last 2 years of commercial experience. Some of the technologies I worked the most are:

- Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA/JDBC, Spring Security, Hibernate
- Kotlin on server-side
- React, TypeScript, NextJS, NodeJS
- Relational databases, MongoDB, Redis
- Generative AI, LLMs
- AWS, Docker

I’ve always been fascinated by Open-Source projects and its community and were participating in it way before my first commercial experience. One of the Open-Source project I’m proud to be involved in is [Datafaker](https://github.com/datafaker-net/datafaker).

I also believe that the best way to consolidate knowledge of something is to try to explain it to others which is the main reason why I write articles on interesting to me topics. You can read them at my [personal website](https://panilya.github.io/posts/) or at [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/4453271/panilya.html).
