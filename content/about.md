My name is Ilya Pantsyr and I spend most of my time in front of the computer. I study at Chernivtsi National University (ChNU) in Ukraine, majoring in Software Engineering (2021-2025). For many years I've been exploring and learning something new about the endless world of programming and computers. At the moment, I do not work anywhere and do not have commercial experience, so I improving my skills on pet projects and looking forward to my first offer.
