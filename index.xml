It explores various techniques such as multi-stage builds, jlink, jdeps, and experimenting with base images. By implementing these optimizations, deployments can be faster and resource usage can be optimized.
The problem Since Java 11, there is no pre-bundled JRE provided. As a result, basic Dockerfiles without any optimization can result in large image sizes. In the absence of a provided JRE, it becomes necessary to explore techniques and optimizations to reduce the size of JVM Docker images.</description></item><item><title>Class Loaders in JVM: An Overview</title><link>https://panilya.github.io/posts/class_loaders_overview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panilya.github.io/posts/class_loaders_overview/</guid><description>Class loaders are an essential part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but many developers consider them to be mysterious. This article aims to demystify the subject by providing a basic understanding of how class loading works in the JVM.
What are classloaders In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), classes are loaded dynamically and found through a process called class loading. Class loading is the process of loading a class from its binary representation (usually a .</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://panilya.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panilya.github.io/about/</guid><description>My name is Illia and I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Developer with interest in backend systems.
